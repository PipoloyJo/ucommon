UCommon Library NEWS -- history of visible user changes. Updated 2007-11-24.

UCommon 0.4 codebase completed and ready for release with the introduction of
the GNU GPL V3.  This is a complete rewrite of UCommon as a C++ library for
threading and design patterns suitable for deeply embedded targets.

UCommon 0.7 codebase now has core documentation and basic library theory
in header files.  This documentation can be generated with doxygen or by
using "make doxy".

UCommon 1.0 release has been simplified, fully documented, and modified in
specific ways to simplify the migration and merge with GNU Common C++ to
form GNU Common C++ 2.0.
