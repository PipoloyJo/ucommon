ABI changes:

	DetachedThread delete this into dealloc() virtual...

	Mutex::protect/release can use "const" void objects...?

	Maybe re-think mapped memory for smart self management?

	Add "joinable" bool for handling of join when running thread terminated
    so that isRunning() has "expected" behavior?
