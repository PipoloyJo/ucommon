Description: Portable c++ runtime for threads and sockets
 uCommon is a lightweight C++ library to facilitate using C++ design patterns
 even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems using uClibc
 along with POSIX threading support. For this reason, UCommon disables language
 features that consume memory or introduce runtime overhead. UCommon introduces
 some design patterns from Objective-C, such as reference counted objects,
 memory pools, and smart pointers. UCommon introduces some new concepts for
 handling of thread locking and synchronization.
