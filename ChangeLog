From ucommon 0.9.2 to 0.9.3
- use std::runtime_exception instead of abort when using c++ runtime library
- crit macro allows std::runtime_exception processing for c++ runtime library
- check for old and new style c++ stream i/o classes, added OLD_STDCPP
- replaced NOSTDCPP with reversed & revised NEW_STDCPP flag unless OLD_STDCPP
- classes documented and doxygenized.
- expanded linked list support with head/tail and insert options.

From ucommon 0.9.1 to 0.9.2
- fix critical bug in Socket::equal tests...

From ucommon 0.9.0 to 0.9.1
- removed AutoObject
- migrated thread functions to use pure win32 threading for mingw32; no
  more redhat pthread-win32.  This became possible when we dropped
  cancellable threads.
- fixed cc mode library build because libtool still forces libstdc++!

From ucommon 0.8.2 to 0.9.0
- slight change to thread init for pthread-win32 static libs.
- new steplock formed purely from staircase mutexes.
- new event timer for timed completion event signalling.
- removed cancellable thread concepts to simplify thread model!

From ucommon 0.8.1 to 0.8.2
- conditional lock protect for shared recursive/short lock use.

From ucommon 0.8.0 to 0.8.1
- fix for pthread without setschedprio.

From ucommon 0.7.0 to 0.8.0
- fix for timerqueue class.
- potential writer starvation issues resolved in rwlock/condlock classes.
- consolidated and improved Conditional timed waits.
- introduction of transformable conditional locking.
- access shared locking extended to cover transformable conditional locks.
- default compile mode is now stdcpp; first step in gnu common c++ merge.

From ucommon 0.6.1 to 0.7.0
- added basic thread priority support
- changed base configure options to avoid collisions with other packages
- added getservice interface to get socket port #
- added charbuf template
- cidr policy chains simplified
- some rationalization and improvement in socket class with the ability
  to compare addresses, manipulate address lists, etc.
- string finding with deliminators.
- first pass at offering real documentation for the library via doxygen.

From ucommon 0.6.0 to 0.6.1
- support for static libpthreadGC2
- support for w32 address conversion

From ucommon 0.5.0 to 0.6.0
- detached & pooled thread exit support fixed
- equal test for socket address
- getinterface to find interface to destination address
- subnet test for socket address comparison
- getaddress replaces hosttostr

From ucommon 0.4.0 to 0.5.0
- rwlock now also recursive writers
- clarification of conditional locking
- generic rexlock type replaces recursive mutex

Initial Release 0.4.0
