.SH NAME
scrub \- securely erase files by filling with random data first.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scrub \fI[options]\fR \fIpaths...\fR 
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is used to securely erase files.  This is accomplished by
filling the file with random data in pre-sized chunks.  Multiple passes
of random data may also be used.  The pre-sized chunks are used to remove
information about exact original file size.  Other options include random
renaming of the original file before deletion and the use of truncation to
break down meta-data on what blocks in the file system were originally 
associated with a securely deleted file.  This is specifically intended to 
make it harder to perform forensic analysis on securely erased files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--blocksize\fR \fIsize\fR
Set the default block size (in 1 k increments) for scrub to use when
writing random data.  This effects both the final file length, which will
be aligned to the specified size, and the way the truncate option decomposes
files.  The default is 1k.
.TP
\fB--follow\fR
Dereference and follow symlinks, erasing the target file.
.TP
\fB--passes\fR \fIcount\fR
The number of passes used when writing random data.  The default is 1 pass.
.TP
\fB--recursive\fR
If argument is a directory, recursively scan directory and any subdirectory
contents as arguments.
.TP
\fB--rename\fR
Rename the file randomly before deletion to clear persistant inode data.
.TP
\fB--truncate\fR
Decompose the file through truncation to break down file system page maps.
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR
Display each file being processed to the console.
.TP
\fB--help\fR
Outputs help screen for the user.
