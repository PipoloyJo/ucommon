.SH DESCRIPTION
This command is used to manipulate and echo command line arguments to
standard out.  This can include adding quotes around each argument passed
or a seperator, or to output each argument on a separate line.  The program
source also offers a basic example of how to use shell argument parsing and
localization in ucommon.
